<h2>ðŸ‘¾ About the project:</h2>
<p>I started learning Django a few weeks ago and decided to make a project to test and improve my skills with this module.</p>
<p>The project isn't completed yet, as I plan to add more features to it as soon as I start learning JavaScript and PostgreSQL. So new features will be added to this project in the future.</p>
<p>I also plan to maybe deploy it to AWS as way to learn more about this services.</p>
